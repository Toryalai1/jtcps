# The R089B

This is a resistor array, described by Lo√Øc in his CPS2 work. Pins are as follows:

pin 1 is common, all resistors connect to this pin. From pins 2 to 7, each resistor is roughly twice the value of the previous one, starting at 100 Ohm: 100, 220, 470, 1k, 2.2k and 4.7k.

-Colour signals connect to 2.2k, 1k, 470 and 220 Ohm
-Bright signals connect to 1k, 470, 220 and 100 Ohm
