# PAL Dumps
PAL dumps cam be obtained from MAME rom sets directly. Use the tool jedutil in order to extract the equations from them. The device is usually a gal16v8. For instance:

```
jedutil -view wl24b.1a gal16v8
```

In order to see the equations for Willow's PAL.

# Simulation

## Game
1. Generate a rom file using the MRA tool
2. Update the symbolic link rom.bin in ver/game to point to it
3. If all goes well, `go.sh` should update the sdram.hex file
   But if sdram.hex is a symbolic link to something else it might
   fail. You can delete sdram.hex first so it gets recreated

   `go.sh` will fill up sdram.hex with zeros in order to avoid x's in
   simulation.

4. Apply patches if appropiate. The script `apply_patches.sh` can generate
   some alternative hex files which skip some of the test code of the game
   so it boots up more quickly

5. While simulation is running, it is possible to update the output video
   files by running `raw2jpg.sh`

Some Verilog macros:

1. FORCE_GRAY ignore palette and use a 4-bit gray scale for everything
